# About this project
This is currently a lab that I haven't quite got down yet. The goal of this lab is to use particle swarm optimization to find the proper xi values to minimize functions in a 10 dimensional space. I only have the first function accomplished (sum(x^2)), but sometimes the results are a bit wacky.
